Merry Christmas to you all!

I am going to use this blog as a place where like minded people can hang out and have productive discussion resulting in everyone learning new things. I am a security enthusiast and like to indulge in deep meaningful conversation about different areas in Security. Some of my main interests are Penetration Testing, Cryptography, Web application, Zero days, Mathematics, Software Development.

Did you know that when was the first website launched "The link is a snapshot of the CERN site, the first website, as of November 1992. The Web was publicly announced (via a posting to the Usenet newsgroup alt.hypertext) on August 6, 1991. Originally Tim Berners-Lee's web catalog at CERN."?

Yeah, I didn't either.
